# Java-GUI-application
What i learned after completing this project:

1. implenting Swing package for GUI generation that i learnt while studying JAVA.
2. connecting MYSQL database with an application.
3. using GUI for firing queries from the application into the database.

This was a personal project of mine that I made in the second year of my undergraduate degree course from Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology, in december 2019.

The application is linked to a mysql database and uses GUI to register,review,update and delete participant's details into the database, for seminars,college fests,etc.
It employs Swing package for end-user interaction using the graphical UI, and MYSQL for maintaining the databse.
